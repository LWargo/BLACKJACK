# BlackJack
## Description
Welcome to your classic game of BlackJack! 
In this game, you can play against a mysterious dealer who is revealed at the end of every round!

## Purpose
This game was created for CSCI 3312 Intro to Game Development at Trinity University. 
The assignment called for an implementation of BlackJack.
## Further Development
If I was to continue building this game, I would make the following changes:
- Instead of buttons for going to the choosing backing panel or game rules, I would love to implement clickable spinning arrows. I tried to implement this but failed.
- The player could change the value of a bet.
- I really wanted to make custom cards but did not have the time to do so. 
- I would make a cooler end-game animation.
